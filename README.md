# Store-backend
## Description
Every website needs a back end to manage how a user interacts with the site.  This is the back end for a store that uses sql with 4 models.  The main 3 models are category, product, and tag.  The 4th model is productTag, which is a helper model connecting products to tags.  
## Example
